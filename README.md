## About

*Lama2* is a Plain-Text powered REST API client & manager built for serious engineering teams.
*Lama2* specifies the [`.l2` syntax](https://hexmos.com/lama2/tutorials/examples.html) for describing APIs, and implements a [CLI](https://hexmos.com/lama2/tutorials/installation.html) to execute `.l2` files. Engineers [collaborate](https://hexmos.com/lama2/tutorials/collaboration.html) on `.l2` files using version control. *Lama2* [integrates](https://hexmos.com/lama2/tutorials/editor.html) nicely with
IDEs and text-editors as well. Think of *Lama2* as [**Markdown for APIs.**](https://hexmos.com/lama2/reference/philosophy.html)

## Benefits 

1. **Plain-Text files:** Store APIs in the Plain-Text `.l2` API files. [Simple](https://hexmos.com/lama2/explanation/l2format.html) and [human-friendly](https://hexmos.com/lama2/explanation/syntax.html) syntax. Learn [basics](https://hexmos.com/lama2/tutorials/examples.html) within  minutes!
1. **Simple CLI:** Launch the [CLI](https://hexmos.com/lama2/tutorials/installation.html) tool `l2` on API files to make REST API requests.
1. **Editor support:** Invoke *Lama2* from your [favorite text editor](https://hexmos.com/lama2/tutorials/installation.html#from-vs-code) or IDE. Helpful documentation and tool support to [build editor extensions](https://hexmos.com/lama2/tutorials/editor.html) included.
1. **Longevity & track-ability:** Commit `.l2` files to `git` or other version control for long life & change tracking.
1. **Collaboration:** Share [API repo](https://hexmos.com/lama2/tutorials/collaboration.html) with teammates and colleagues to collaborate
1. **Documentation:** [Explore](https://hexmos.com/lama2/index.html) examples, how-tos, explanations, references, FAQ/RAQs, and diagrams. Documentation is a priority, so that you never have to get lost.
1. **Extensibility:** `.l2` syntax is implemented as a *recursive descent parser*, based on a [formal grammar](https://hexmos.com/lama2/reference/grammar.html). [Dig into details](https://hexmos.com/lama2/reference/parser.html) and [implement](https://github.com/HexmosTech/Lama2/tree/main/parser) new syntax (ex: to support `websockets`)
1. **Import from Postman:** Let *Lama2* help you [convert](https://hexmos.com/lama2/tutorials/postman.html) Postman
data dumps into a  nice  Plain-Text Lama2 repo.

## Installation/Update

For **Linux/MacOS** systems, run the following command to either install or update *Lama2*:

```
curl -s https://hexmos.com/lama2/install.sh | bash -s
```

Learn more about other installation methods from [our docs](https://hexmos.com/lama2/tutorials/installation.html).

### (Optional) Import your collections from Postman

Follow [guide](https://hexmos.com/lama2/tutorials/postman.html)
 to import your existing Postman collections into a Plain-Text
 Lama2 repository.
### Self update

An easier way to update the binary to latest release is through:

```
l2 -u
```


### VSCode Extension

Find *Lama2 for VSCode* at the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hexmos.Lama2). The extension requires the *l2* command available (usually at `/usr/local/bin/l2`).

## Design Philosophy

Lama2 takes inspiration from Markdown. Think of our approach as Markdown for APIs.

In particular, we strive to:

1. Delegate subtasks to mature and preferably open tools:
    1. API Collaboration - git
    1. API Organization - OS file system + IDEs
    1. API Editing - VSCode/IDEs
    1. API Requests - HTTPie
1. Start a language formalization effort from the beginning (learning from Markdown history)
1. Keep language syntax simple
1. Invest into good documentation; however, ensure users can perform competently without referencing documentation as much as possible.
1. Strive to keep components decoupled
