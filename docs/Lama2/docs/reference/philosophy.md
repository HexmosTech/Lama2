*Lama2* takes inspiration from *Markdown*. Think of our approach as **Markdown for APIs**. 

In particular, we strive to:

1. Delegate subtasks to mature and preferably open tools:
    1. API Collaboration - git
    1. API Organization - OS file manager + IDEs
    1. API Editing - VSCode/IDEs
    1. API Requests - HTTPie
1. Adhere to a continuous language formalization effort from the beginning (learning from Markdown history)
1. Keep language syntax simple; don't sacrifice readability for tiny functionality gains.
1. Invest into good documentation
1. Keep components decoupled
