*Lama2* takes inspiration from *Markdown*. Think of our approach as **Markdown for APIs**. 

In particular, we strive to:

1. Delegate subtasks to mature and preferably open tools:
    1. API Collaboration - git
    1. API Organization - OS file manager + IDEs
    1. API Editing - VSCode/IDEs
    1. API Requests - HTTPie ([httpie-go](https://github.com/nojima/httpie-go), to be specific)
    1. Request Chaining - Embedded Javascript
1. Adhere to a continuous language formalization effort from the beginning (learning from Markdown history)
1. Keep language syntax simple; don't sacrifice readability for tiny functionality gains.
1. Invest into good documentation; however, ensure users can perform competently without referencing documentation as much as possible.
1. Keep components decoupled
