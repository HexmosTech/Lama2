# LiveAPI: Capture Developer Attention Instantly with Executable API Docs

Static API docs often lose customer attention before the developers even try your APIs.

With LiveAPI, developers can execute APIs instantly right within their browser, so that you capture developer attention within the first 30 seconds of their visit.

LiveAPI uses Lama2 Language for executing the API requests, and supports language conversion as well.
