Lama2 specifies the .l2 syntax for describing APIs, and implements a CLI to execute .l2 files. Engineers collaborate on .l2 files using version control. Lama2 integrates nicely with IDEs and text-editors as well. Think of Lama2 as Markdown for APIs. Benefits \u00b6 Plain-Text files: Store APIs in the Plain-Text .l2 API files. Simple and human-friendly syntax. Learn basics within minutes! Simple CLI: Launch the CLI tool l2 on API files to make REST API requests. Editor support: Invoke Lama2 from your favorite text editor or IDE. Helpful documentation and tool support to build editor extensions included. Longevity & track-ability: Commit .l2 files to git or other version control for long life & change tracking. Collaboration: Share API repo with teammates and colleagues to collaborate Documentation: Explore examples, how-tos, explanations, references, FAQ/RAQs, and diagrams. Documentation is a priority, so that you never have to get lost. Extensibility: .l2 syntax is implemented as a recursive descent parser , based on a formal grammar . Dig into details and implement new syntax (ex: to support websockets ) Tip Coming from postman? Let Lama2 help you convert Postman data dumps into a nice Plain-Text Lama2 repo.

We deal with 100s of internal APIs, and so felt a need for a robust workflow for defining, sharing and updating APIs within our teams. Traditional solutions such as Postman/Insomnia implement the collaboration features within their applications, and also tend to charge a fee for collaboration. We felt using git is the right way to collaborate on APIs, rather than any custom built solution. So, in a matter of 2-days we got a regex-based prototype DSL language to store API files. Lots of issues cropped up over time, but we kept making improvements to Lama2 as needs arose. Hexmos accumulated 100s of APIS over time. Then, we decided that the tool deserves to be out there, benefitting teams that want to collaborate on APIs over git . So, to make it happen, first we invested into formalizing the grammar, and implementing the DSL as a hand-written recursive descent parser. Then we invested into helpful documentation, demos and so on.

Comments start with # \u00b6 Lines starting with # are comments and hence ignored altogether All HTTP Verbs supported - including the common GET/POST/PUT \u00b6 Fully supported: GET|HEAD|POST|PUT|DELETE|CONNECT|OPTIONS|TRACE|PATCH JSON is the default submission type, but MULTIPART is supported too \u00b6 varjson is a simpler syntax to specify flat JSONs \u00b6 varjson values are defined as follows: hello=world foo=bar The above results in a JSON submission of the form: { \"hello\": \"world\", \"foo\": \"bar\" } Nested JSON can simply be dumped at the end of the document \u00b6 The JSON recognition engine is quite lenient. It can deal with minor errors in the format (such as having single quotes instead of double quotes, trailing garbage, or an extra comma after the last element in an array,).

Container , error ) Method VarJSON behaves in two ways depending on whether `multipart` is true or not. If there is no multipart, then VarJSON tries to match one or more VarJSONPairs However, if there is multipart, we try to match zero or more VarJSON, followed by zero or more file fields (separated by `@`). If there is no match at all, we return a ParseError; otherwise the we return the parsed data. func (*Lama2Parser) VarJSONPair \u00b6 func ( p * Lama2Parser ) VarJSONPair () ( * gabs . Container , error ) VarJSONPair tries to match key and value separated by `=`. The key and value can either be a quoted string, or an unquoted VarJSON unquoted string. If there is no match for either, a ParseError is returned. func (*Lama2Parser) VarJSONUnquoted \u00b6 func ( p * Lama2Parser ) VarJSONUnquoted () ( * gabs . Container , error ) VarJSONUnquoted matches a string of characters other than `=` and returns them as a String type MinimalParser \u00b6 MinimalParser enforces concrete Types to have a Start() method, from which parsing process begins. In the present case, `Lama2Parser` adds up dozens of of methods to implement `.l2` syntax type MinimalParser interface { Start () ( * gabs . Container , error ) } type Parser \u00b6 Struct Parser stores information about the parsing process throughout. 1. Text: Incoming text is stored as an array of runes, to correctly handle unicode characters 2. Pos: Indicates the index position in Text which has already been scanned; starts with -1 3. TotalLen: Number of runes in the input 4. Pm: Composing an external MinimalParser (such as Lama2Parser) which builds upon Parser to provide the new language recognition capabilities 5. ruleMethodMap: Scans through Pm, and creates a mapping from method name to method value through reflection 6. LineNum: Number of normalized newlines found till now.

A good description of CharClass is available here: Read the section \"Processing Character Ranges\" at https://www.booleanworld.com/building-recursive-descent-parsers-definitive-guide/ func (*Parser) Init \u00b6 func ( p * Parser ) Init () Method Init creates the most important data stucture for parsing: ruleMethodMap. We use reflection to create a mapping of each Pm.\\<method_name> to \\<method_value> func (*Parser) Keyword \u00b6 func ( p * Parser ) Keyword ( kw string , eatWsStart bool , eatWsEnd bool , caseInsensitive bool ) ([] rune , error ) Method Keyword is a versatile; it can eat whitespace before/after the expected string, and it can do an optionally case insensitive match for the keyword func (*Parser) LookAhead \u00b6 func ( p * Parser ) LookAhead ( rules [] string ) bool func (*Parser) Match \u00b6 func ( p * Parser ) Match ( rules [] string ) ( * gabs . Container , error ) Method Match is the most important of all in the parser package. Match takes in a slice of rules (essentially method names), and then executes them one by one. On successful match, we return a gabs Container with `error` set to `nil` When a rule fails to match, we reset the scan position to initial position; moreover, we keep a continuous track of the farthest/longest match till present. The farthest match error is potentially the most useful error message to the user; thus, for error report, Match returns the farthest matching error func (*Parser) MatchUntil \u00b6 func ( p * Parser ) MatchUntil ( end string ) ( * gabs . Container , error ) func (*Parser) Parse \u00b6 func ( p * Parser ) Parse ( text string ) ( * gabs . Container , error ) Method Parse normalizes newlines and then creates a rune version of the input data. The Start() method proceeds to process the rune version of data func (*Parser) SetText \u00b6 func ( p * Parser ) SetText ( text string ) Method SetText is a utility used primarily in testing, when we don't want to call Start() automatically as in Parse func (*Parser) SplitCharRanges \u00b6 func ( p * Parser ) SplitCharRanges ( charClass string ) ([] string , error ) func (*Parser) Start \u00b6 func ( p * Parser ) Start () * gabs .
